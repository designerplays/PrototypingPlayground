# Prototyping Playground

Welcome to my game prototyping playground! A collection of interactive game prototypes.

## Available Prototypes

### [Coin Toss](prototypes/coin-toss/index.html)
Flip a coin and see if it lands on heads or tails

### [Hex Map Explorer](prototypes/hex-map/index.html)
Explore and build a hexagonal tile map inspired by Dorf Romantik. Click adjacent hexes to explore, choose from 3 random tiles, and build your map with a finite pool of resources.
